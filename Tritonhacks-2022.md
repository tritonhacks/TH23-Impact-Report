# TritonHacks 2023

## Event Summary

TritonHacks is a two-day high school level hackathon aimed at providing greater access to CS education, specifically for disadvantaged local communities lacking their own resources to prepare students for careers in STEM fields. All aspects of the hackathon are arranged by members of CSforeach, a student organization at UC San Diego that strives to make access to CS opportunities and resources more equitable for each and every student.

In addition to typical hackathon incentives such as workshops, teams, event swag and prizes, we placed an emphasis on individual mentorship during the hackathon to ensure that beginners have ways to reach out for help and unblock themselves on their projects. Every student that participated in TritonHacks had access to tutors to help with code debugging and a mentor to their team that checked in with them regularly as a point of contact and welcoming figure.

We also offered starter kits ([Starter Kits](https://tritonhacks.notion.site/e7bc9e3f6a9f4768a53996791abc2620?v=e918b4c708824a239e73756b999e0fab)) designed and documented by our organizing team for students to use as a framework and guide for their project to learn a new technology during the weekend. This year, our event theme was focused on space exploration so our 5 starter kits were built to address this theme. We had tutors available throughout the event that were proficient in many technologies to answer questions relating to any of the starter kits, Github, software engineering, and any other issues.

As our event focused heavily on community in San Diego, we hosted our hackathon on campus at UC San Diego in the Computer Science and Engineering Building to show students what a university looks like and like as a college student. All meals during the event were catered by local restaurants and vendors.

We hosted a couple non-technical and technical workshops to help students in their journey to build a project: *'Introduction to Space + How to win a hackathon!'*, *Design & Prototyping*, *Intro to Web Development*, *Intro to Data Science*, *Boardgame Social Event*, and *Presentation Workshop: How to present the design process*.

## Tech Impact / Diversity

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

As the objective of our hackathon was to reach out to San Diegan high school students of underrepresented backgrounds, we kept track of the hackers that attended. We had 66 males, 17 females, and 1 non-binary person. Roughly 20.2% of attendees were female.

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?

## Top Projects

While all the projects can be found on our [Devpost gallery](https://tritonhacks23.devpost.com/project-gallery), here's a little about the grand prize winners! Each of the projects are hosted on GitHub repos for everybody to see how the project was built at the end. Some teams used GitHub for collaboration during this event.

[Stargazing Forever](https://devpost.com/software/stargazing-forever): "One of our team members loves stars. He has a telescope and all. He went to Joshua Tree once but realized it was hard to see stars. He then realized that there should be a place where he can tell if it is an excellent place to see the stars." To tackle this issue, the team built a website that takes in user input of a location and outputs a stargazing point value, with a higher value being a better place to watch the stars.

[Escape the Earth](https://devpost.com/software/escape-the-earth): "We were inspired by a curiosity and interest over the complex process and calculations to determine if a rocket will successfully orbit earth. We also were inspired by a lack of awareness on the impact of space flight on the environment. Our website simulation allows users to design a rocket based on parameters such as amount of fuel and weight of payload and launch it into space. Users are rewarded for minimizing fuel while maximizing payload and successfully making it into earth's orbit" 

[Asteroid Attack](https://devpost.com/software/asteroid-attack-47p0h2): "We took inspiration from the space theme of this year's hackathon to develop a space-themed game. Our project is a game that has multiple spaceships the player can pick to navigate through incoming asteroids and meteors. The further the player is able to go without crashing, the higher the player's score gets."

## Whatâ€™s Next?

TritonHacks is an annual hackathon. Our next event will likely take place around the same time next year (May 2024). This year, in our third iteration of TritonHacks, we were able to successfully host another in-person event and by doing so, we continued to lay a foundation for future iterations of the event and learned the various responsibilities required to host a hackathon. With enough support, we hope to scale up our event next year by reaching a bigger, more diverse audience who may not have known about the event or been comfortable enough to attend this year.

We had an overwhelming positive response from the hackers that competed - learning new skills and making new connections at the event! With the support from UC San Diego and corporate sponsors, we were able to take TritonHacks to the next level as an event with a real impact on its community. Many of our hackers this year were first-time hackers and we hope that they each continue to share and foster their interest in STEM topics through passion projects, higher education, and hackathon participation!
